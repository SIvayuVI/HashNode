## DSA-Python

# **DSA-Python**

We are going to see Data Structures and Algorithms parallel and I will use Python language for code implementations.

## **Algorithms:**

A sequence of finite steps to perform some tasks.

Example : Multiplications of two numbers

### Properties of Algorithms:

1. It should terminate after finite amount of times.
2. Produce at-least one output
3. Independent of any programming languages.
4. The output should be deterministic

### Steps to construct an Algorithm:

1. Problem definition
2. Design a Algorithm 
    - Divide and Conquer 
    - Greedy Algorithm 
    - Dynamic Programming and many more
3. Draw a flow chart
4. Testing Phase
5. Implementation
6. [Analysis](https://sivayuvi79.hashnode.dev/dsa-analysis)


```Python
while(True):
  print("DSA using Python")
``` 

The above code is not a valid algorithm why because there is no termination in the code.
Lets discuss each topics one by one.
